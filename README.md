# LD36-NoireStealth
"CRTs are ancient, right?" is a fast-paced and somewhat funny take on the stealth and FPS genres, providing multiple ways to deal with the threats in each level.

Do you rampage through, killing all who oppose you, or stealth it up like a ninja? Brute-force the passwords, or look for clues? Collect all the things, or just make a beeline for the exit once you've gotten your target?

This game's still in development, with no future support being fully guaranteed. Made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 36: "Ancient Technology".
